## Introduction

The engine (baserom) for Skyland, without the filesystem attached. This repo just contains an engine ROM, and python script for attaching all of the LISP scripts to the engine. See https://github.com/evanbowman/skyland for more info about the game.

## Instructions

Checkout this repository. cd into the build/ directory. Run bundle.sh (p.s. I used python3.8.10).
